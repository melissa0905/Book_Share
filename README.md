Book share project is a Ruby on Rails project.After the user is registered and logged in, they can share their favorite books on this platform.In addition, they can comment on books shared by other users, make suggestions from their own books to other users and perform the tradable.Also, this project was created using MVC pattern.

## New Features:

* The trade button is not displayed if the user does not have a book.

* New navigation bar has been added. 

* When a validation error appears on the add book page, the form structure is fixed.

* A book cannot be created with 0 and -1 pages.It was realized by giving the feature of validating to the page number at the model level.
